# 1st_team_project Data-HousePrice Predicting House Prices Regression

## Objective/Goal
To identify the variables affecting house prices, e.g. area, number of rooms, bathrooms, etc.

To create a linear model that quantitatively relates house prices with variables such as number of rooms, area, number of bathrooms, etc.

To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. how well these variables can predict house prices.

## Role
We worked independently for 1,5month for our 1st_team project to extract, clean, analyze, visualize, create pipeline and fit house price data.

## Data
It contains 1460 training data points and 81 features that might help us predict the selling price of a house.
The project consists of parts:
